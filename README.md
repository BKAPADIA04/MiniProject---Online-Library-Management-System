ONLINE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and secure Online Library Management
System that caters to the needs of both library administrators and users. Specific objectives include:
OBJECTIVES:
1. Implementation of user authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to member
accounts.
2. Incorporation of password-protected administrative access to prevent unauthorized usage.
3. Development of functionalities for adding, deleting, modifying, and searching book and member
details.
4. Implementation of file-locking mechanisms using system calls to ensure data consistency and
concurrency control.
5. Utilization of socket programming to facilitate concurrent access to the library database by
multiple clients.

FUNCTIONALITIES:
The Online Library Management System (OLMS) is equipped with the following functionalities:
1. User Authentication: Members are required to pass through a login system to access their
accounts, ensuring data privacy and security.
2. Administrative Access: Password-protected administrative access is provided to librarians,
enabling them to manage book transactions and member information.
3. Book Management: Administrators can add, delete, modify, and search for specific book details,
ensuring efficient management of library resources.
4. File-Locking Mechanisms: Proper file-locking mechanisms are implemented using system calls
to protect critical data sections and ensure data consistency.
5. Concurrent Access: The system employs socket programming to service multiple clients
concurrently, facilitating seamless access to library resources.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
The Online Library Management System (OLMS) is implemented using system calls for various
operations, including process management, file handling, file locking, multithreading, and interprocess
communication. Socket programming is utilized for client-server communication, allowing multiple
clients to access the library database simultaneously.
